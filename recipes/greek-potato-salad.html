        <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
            <p>This Greek potato salad is 
            a refreshing change from classic mayo potato salad. It has
             lighter and brighter flavors, goes well with most entrees, and we particular
             ly enjoy it during the summer for BBQs or any backyard gathering.</p>

             <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
<ul>
